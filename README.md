# Budgeting app

## How the budgeting app works
The budgeting app works by opening up an account (no real bank accounts involved as everything is done locally). You can then make deposits and withdrawals the the $0.00 balance. The magic happens when you add your inputs like your expenses (ex. rent), your loans, your job information, and other scenarios. When you go back to the main transactions page, it uses the information you inputted to generate your projected transactions in the future. You can enter any date range for any account. You can even put in your wishlist items so that you can know the earliest time that you can buy that wishlist item. You can even transfer between accounts.

## Why I created the budgeting app
I have trouble making decisions with budgeting and keep making impulsive purchases. I want an idea of what the future would be like money-wise. I wanted a way that I can input all my expenses and incomes and automatically visualise my future transactions.
