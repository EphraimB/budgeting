# Budgeting app

## How the budgeting app works
The budgeting app works by opening up an account (no real bank accounts involved as everything is done locally). You can then make deposits and withdrawals the the $0.00 balance. The magic happens when you add your inputs like your expenses (ex. rent), your loans, your job information, and other scenarios. When you go back to the main transactions page, it uses the information you inputted to generate your projected transactions in the future. You can enter any date range for any account. You can even put in your wishlist items so that you can know the earliest time that you can buy that wishlist item. You can even transfer between accounts. A bonus feature is that if the budgeting app gets hosted, it can run cron jobs to automatically adjust the balance on the date of a transaction.

## Why I created the budgeting app
I have trouble making decisions with budgeting and keep making impulsive purchases. I want an idea of what the future would be like money-wise. I wanted a way that I can input all my expenses and incomes and automatically visualise my future transactions.

## My goal on the budgeting app
I've been working on the budgeting app for a couple of years and trying to work on as many scenarios as possible. I want it at some point to automatically upload a budgeting scrapbook to Google Sheets via plugins. It would be very fancy and have a lot of tabs including an overview tab with charts and a tab per month (previous and future transactions). I also want to complete commute expenses where it takes into account you're commuting information. Another future goal is food expenses where it will take into account your groceries, recipes, and even cooking (for an even future plan of an electricity bill).
